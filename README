Bubo the JSON version of the latest OpenCyc OWL ontology document.
The OpenCyc project is here: http://www.opencyc.org/

Hello All,

I was doing some playing with the OpenCyc-latest.owl file and wanted to test it out in a NoSQL DB, So I converted it to JSON if anyone is interested in the project check it out:

TODO:

It has recently come to my attention that there are some dead links in the data set. So I will be looking into correcting those errors and uploading them, if anyone out there knows any specifics please let me know so I can correct them.


Also,
I still need to do a verification check that all the data was ported properly, (will be easier now that its in a DB)
