TODO:

It has recently come to my attention that there are some dead links in the data set. So I will be looking into correcting those errors and uploading them, if anyone out there knows any specifics please let me know so I can correct them.


Also,
I still need to do a verification check that all the data was ported properly, (will be easier now that its in a DB)

Hello All,
I was doing some playing with the OpenCyc-latest.owl file and wanted to test it out in a NoSQL DB, 
So I converted it to JSON, Hope it helps!
