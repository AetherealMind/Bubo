Bubo the JSON version of the latest OpenCyc OWL ontology document.


Hello All,

I was doing some playing with the OpenCyc-latest.owl file and wanted to test it out in a NoSQL DB, So I am converting it to JSON if anyone is interested in the project check it out:

http://github.com/cognition/Bubo

I just committed the first 19 parts of the ontology and working on converting the rest - then the next plan is to make 2 separate files one as a single json "table" and the other with each item separated into its on json "table"

Hope it helps!
